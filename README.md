- Dynamically updates progress using JavaScript.
- Smooth animation for a polished user experience.
- Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the loading bar.
- **CSS**: Styles the loading bar and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamically controls the loading progress.
